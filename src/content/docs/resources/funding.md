If you need some money for paying expenses of your privacy-related project, then we can help you with that too.

We are developing a transparent grant system that will serve as the main way to redistribute the majority of our income to (our) projects.

## Scope of funding

* cost of equipment and necessary tools
* operating costs
* marketing and promotional expenses

## Funding Requests (FR)

Funding requests is a transparent application process to receive money from our [Treasury](/treasury).

All funding requests are handled through Issues in the [`@web3privacy/funding`](https://github.com/web3privacy/funding) repository.
