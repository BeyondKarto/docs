title: Privacy Annual Report
---

Following our [Privacy Market Overview](https://github.com/web3privacy/web3privacy/blob/main/Market%20overview/Privacy%20market%20outlook%20in%20Web3%20by%20Mykola%20Siusko%20(Jan%202023).pdf) (Jan 2023) we intend to produce a comprehensive report to showcase all happenings and achievements of the year. This will consist in structuring the overall picture of the web3-privacy market and exploring hundreds of independent companies - and their connections - with the potential for unity and collaboration.  


### Why is it important
Navigating the complex and delicate realm of privacy is very challenging. Although the focus has recently been put back on this foundamental issue, there is a lack of comprehensive overview and there is still little collaboration in this regard. With regulators centralizing the market and surveillance on the rise, the need for privacy champions is clear, especially with actions against private crypto and platforms like Tornado Cash highlighting the risks. Rather than vying for the top tech and perk, we should work together to create a web that prioritizes our collective privacy.
