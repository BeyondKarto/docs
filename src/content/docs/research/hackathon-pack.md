Hacker Manuals & Privacy Guidelines to help the builders deliver practical privacy-enhancing projects, turn them into products, & scale being sustainable.
To showcase and distribute during privacy events worldwide.

## **Current idea** 

**context**: we were actively participating in hackathons core at ETHRome & core at ETHDam, judging & speaking, making [Privacy Corner](https://c24ber.web3privacy.info) at ETHBerlin.

We understood that many people came into privacy after Tornado Cash case or Vitalik promoting privacy solutions & cypherpunk spirit.
But hackers don't get privacy in the bigger context
- surveillance capitalism business models
- centralization of knowledge
- proprietary software etc.

**idea**: we want to come up with "acceleration"/"incubation" umbrella helping devs to reach product-market-fit (read: long-lasting sustainability; example: Rotki, based on Gitcoin, retro grants, reputation).

### goals
- **make meaningful privacy-solutions** -> so accidental in privacy people will do not a dead code
- **build sustainable privacy projects** -> turn hackathon demos into products that will stay
- **re-wire crypto funds into value alligned hands** -> match conscious devs with good mentors, grant programs etc

**Hackathon use-case generator** - micro-service to generate ideas for hackathon privacy-projects + [100 pre-build use-cases](https://github.com/web3privacy/web3privacy/blob/main/Market%20overview/Ethereum%20Ecosystem/Hackathon%20projects.md)
[github](https://github.com/web3privacy/docs/blob/main/src/content/docs/projects/hackathon-use-cases-generator.md), [docs](https://github.com/web3privacy/docs/blob/main/src/content/docs/projects/hackathon-use-cases-generator.md)

**Privacy market DB**: [Explorer](https://explorer.web3privacy.info)

- & everything else from meetups to [summits](https://summit.web3privacy.info/), community, [job board](https://jobs.web3privacy.info), [newsletter](http://news.web3privacy.info), network of expertc etc

## what we will do this year
- [privacy 101 Academy](https://github.com/web3privacy/projects/issues/8)
- Working hackathon use-case generator with the both previous hackathons use-cases & expert takes ([ETHBerlin example](https://cryptpad.fr/pad/#/2/pad/view/sKQtC07xhA5jHvs9cnnBz+rOl74ds9WUPjuusf6y7us/))
- Community Crowdfunding System (CSS) ([reference](https://ccs.getmonero.org) - but for the whole privacy market)
- Social movements mentorship during 1 hackathon - adding humanitarian & direct action knowledge for hackers to build for a real world & real people
- not directly related to the subject (Ethereum Privacy Ecosystem report, events, expanded Explorer, skill board for people seeking jobs in privacy etc)
- TBD
