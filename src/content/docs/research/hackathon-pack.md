title: Hackathon Curation Pack
---

Hacker Manuals & Privacy Guidelines to help the builders to uderstand actual issues in the market.
To showcase and distribute during our [events](https://lu.ma/calendar/manage/cal-WJeK56sraztsiIa) worldwide.

## **Current idea** 

**context**: we were actively participating in hackathons core at ETHRome & core at ETHDam, judging & speaking, making [Privacy Corner](https://c24ber.web3privacy.info) at ETHBerlin.

We understood that many people came into privacy after Tornado Cash case or Vitalik promoting privacy solutions & cypherpunk spirit.
But hackers don't get privacy in the bigger context
- surveillance capitalism business models
- centralization of knowledge
- proprietary software etc.

**idea**: we want to come up with "acceleration"/"incubation" umbrella helping devs to reach product-market-fit (read: long-lasting sustainability; example: Rotki, based on Gitcoin, retro grants, reputation).

### goals
**make meaningful privacy-solutions** -> so accidental in privacy people will do not a dead code
**build sustainable privacy projects** -> turn hackathon demos into products that will stay
**re-wire crypto funds into value alligned hands** -> match conscious devs with good mentors, grant programs etc

### **what we have**:
- [Pagency framework](https://github.com/web3privacy/pagency) for privacy use-cases ideation: github (need to be actualized, I made it long time ago)
- Hackathon use-case generator: [github](https://github.com/web3privacy/docs/blob/main/src/content/docs/projects/hackathon-use-cases-generator.md), [docs](https://github.com/web3privacy/docs/blob/main/src/content/docs/projects/hackathon-use-cases-generator.md)
- Privacy market DB: [Explorer](https://explorer.web3privacy.info)
- & everything else from meetups to [summits](https://summit.web3privacy.info/), community, [job board](https://jobs.web3privacy.info), [newsletter](http://news.web3privacy.info), network of expertc etc

### **what we will do this year**
- [privacy 101 Academy](https://github.com/web3privacy/projects/issues/8)
- working hackathon use-case generator + [200 pre-build use-cases](https://github.com/web3privacy/web3privacy/blob/main/Market%20overview/Ethereum%20Ecosystem/Hackathon%20projects.md) (both from hackathons to expert suggestions what to build)
- not directly related to the subject (Ethereum Privacy Ecosystem report, events, expanded Explorer, skill board for people seeking jobs in privacy etc)
