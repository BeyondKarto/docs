# Event types

We divide events into the following types according to their length and goal:

## Overview

| Type | [Slots](/events#slots) | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Hackathon](#hackathon) | *variable* | a multi-day event including hacking |
| [Summit](#summit) | 10 - 16 | a day-long gathering |
| [Meetup](#meetup) | 3 - 5 | shorter gatherings for a few hours |

## Details of types
### Hackathon

A hackathon is usually a multi-day event focused on creation. What makes it different from other types is that it should end with some work being done, whether it's some privacy-focused projects or pushing our own projects forward.

A Hackathon is usually accompanied by one or more Meetups, or possibly a Summit.

The number of slots at the hackathon is very flexible.

### Summit

The Summit is an all-day event, usually followed by an afterparty.

Summit is usually made up of 10-16 slots.

### Meetup

A meetup is a shorter type of event for 2-6 hours (usually afternoon/evening).

The number of slots at a meetup is usually 3-5.
