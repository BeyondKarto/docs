# ✵ Privacy Beat 

## Project Overview
A ranking system of all privacy-related projects in the Web3.

- [Project details](https://docs.web3privacy.info/projects/db)
- [Live Demo](https://taikai.network/ethrome/hackathons/ethrome-23/projects/clng508ts00lswu01030hpfuq/idea)

A ranking system of all privacy-related projects in the Web3 could help a lot the users to discern and decide who to trust and how to manage their sensible data.

That is why we are developing this comprehensive platform to empower the general public in making informed decisions about the services they choose to trust by clearly and quickly check the privacy levels and security of various Web3 services.

### Scoring Mechanism's details: 
Professional scoring would be a joint R&D with the key web3 people from protocol architects to security specialists. We are collecting feedbacks from privacy experts from the Ethereum Foundation, Railgun, Waku, NYM... while building on the experience of active members from both solar and lunarpunk communities. 

This will help to create an unbiased take from scratch & enabling a transparent working process, accessible to everyone via a forum.

In parallel to the top-down scorecard method, we'll develop and implement a bottom-up community scoring platform too (think of Metacritic exters + users scorings) -> at the end of the day it's the users who have to become the real watchdogs of the industry, signaling about flaws and shortcomings of solutions.

We interviewed 100 privacy players & gathered an MVP vision — we are running a series of 1-on-1 feedback loop sessions to make the scoring model community validated.

# ⌬ Privacy Annual Report 2023

### Project Overview 
Following our [Privacy Market Overview](https://github.com/web3privacy/web3privacy/blob/main/Market%20overview/Privacy%20market%20outlook%20in%20Web3%20by%20Mykola%20Siusko%20(Jan%202023).pdf) (Jan 2023) we intend to produce a comprehensive report to showcase all happenings and achievements of the year. This will consist in structuring the overall picture of the web3-privacy market and exploring hundreds of independent companies - and their connections - with the potential for unity and collaboration. 

### Ecosystem/Market fit - Why is it important now? 
Navigating the complex and delicate realm of privacy is very challenging. Although the focus has recently been put back on this foundamental issue, there is a lack of comprehensive overview and there is still little collaboration in this regard. With regulators centralizing the market and surveillance on the rise, the need for privacy champions is clear, especially with actions against private crypto and platforms like Tornado Cash highlighting the risks. Rather than vying for the top tech and perk, we should work together to create a web that prioritizes our collective privacy.

### Deliverables:
-  Draft of 100+ pages 
-  Final 100+ pages PDF with visuals and metrics

### Budget
- 5k
