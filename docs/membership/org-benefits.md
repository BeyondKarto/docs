## General benefits

### Personal membership for your people

We are primarily a community initiative, based on individuals, so each membership for organisations includes a certain number of free [Personal memberships](/membership/#personal-membership) for your employees, developers or other stakeholders.

### Special support group for member organizations

For organizations that are our members, there is a special closed chat group where representatives of individual organizations can communicate directly with our [Core Team](/core-team) or network with each other.

## Brand-highlighting benefits

### Visibility on our website

Organizations whose membership is public have the option to have their logo and/or name displayed on our [website](https://web3privacy.info) in the "Members" section. The size and importance of the entry corresponds to your Tier.

### Visiblity at our events

We offer our most important members (Tier I + II) the opportunity to present their brand and raise awareness at our [events](/events/) - Summits & Hackathons.

### Highlighting your project in Privacy Explorer

If your organisation is creating a tool, service or product that is listed in our [Privacy Explorer](/projects/privacy-explorer), then as members you are entitled to have that project highlighted with a special sticker.
