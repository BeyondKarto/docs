# Privacy Guides
Extensive privacy guides covering broad audiences from Iranian human rights activists to Ukrainian people living on occupied territories.

Practical guides will match:
- existing privacy solutions from Sismo to NYM with privacy-personas (NGOs, anon donors, activists).
- non-tech people with accessible privacy solutions (with the focus on human rights & sensitive audiences)
- tech-people with advanced privacy solutions & practices
