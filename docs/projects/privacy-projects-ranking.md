# Privacy Projects Ranking

Codename: `Privacy Explorer`

**3in1**: a ranking system, database & comprehensive profiling to empower the general public in discerning the privacy levels, security, and reliability of Web3 projects.

Despite the foundational role that privacy is meant to play in shaping Web3, genuinely impactful initiatives remain scarce. Many projects leverage the concept of privacy as a buzzword or for public relations advantage, rather than addressing tangible issues or enacting substantial changes at the infrastructural and transactional level.

That's why a ranking system of all privacy-related projects in the Web3 could help a lot the users to discern and decide who to trust.

## Value

**General public**
- Find projects you can trust 
- Explore your privacy stack
- Compare projects’ privacy features
- Filter projects by scoring
- Filter projects by ecosystems
- Explore which projects match your use case (like “swap assets”)

**Devs**
- Explore projects delivering privacy
- Research on use-cases
- Improve existing solutions

**Security audit companies / white hackers**
- Find clients lacking security audit (privacy-focused)

**Investors**
- Explore early-stage projects
- Find outstanding builders
- Back critical privacy stack

### About the Scoring Mechanism: 
It will incorporate both expert analysis and community input, to offer impartial resources for evaluating projects.

- Professional scoring would be a joint R&D with the key web3 people from protocol architects to security specialists. We are collecting feedbacks from privacy experts from the Ethereum Foundation, Railgun, Waku, NYM... 

- In parallel to the top-down scorecard method, we'll develop and implement a bottom-up community scoring platform too (think of Metacritic exters + users scorings) -> at the end of the day it's the users who have to become the real watchdogs of the industry, signaling about flaws and shortcomings of solutions.

We interviewed 100 privacy players & gathered an MVP vision — we are running a series of 1-on-1 feedback loop sessions to make the scoring model community validated.
