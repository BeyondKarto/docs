# Privacy Projects Ranking

Codename: `PrivacyBeat`

A ranking system that empowers the general public to discern the privacy levels of various Web3 projects. [Live demo](https://taikai.network/ethrome/hackathons/ethrome-23/projects/clng508ts00lswu01030hpfuq/idea)

Despite the foundational role that privacy is meant to play in shaping Web3, genuinely impactful initiatives remain scarce. Many projects leverage the concept of privacy as a buzzword or for public relations advantage, rather than addressing tangible issues or enacting substantial changes at the infrastructural and transactional level.

That's why a ranking system of all privacy-related projects in the Web3 could help a lot the users to discern and decide who to trust.

### About the Scoring Mechanism: 
It will incorporate both expert analysis and community input, to offer impartial resources for evaluating projects.

- Professional scoring would be a joint R&D with the key web3 people from protocol architects to security specialists. We are collecting feedbacks from privacy experts from the Ethereum Foundation, Railgun, Waku, NYM... 

- In parallel to the top-down scorecard method, we'll develop and implement a bottom-up community scoring platform too (think of Metacritic exters + users scorings) -> at the end of the day it's the users who have to become the real watchdogs of the industry, signaling about flaws and shortcomings of solutions.

We interviewed 100 privacy players & gathered an MVP vision â€” we are running a series of 1-on-1 feedback loop sessions to make the scoring model community validated.
