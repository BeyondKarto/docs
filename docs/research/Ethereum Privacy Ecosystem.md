# Ethereum Privacy Ecosystem: report

Research will cover comprehensive & up to date report on the state of privacy in Ethereum.

## **Details**

Ethereum ecosystem lacks detailed & actual report covering all the projects contributing to Ethereum privacy stack. This creates missunderstanding & shallow view on the state of privacy in Ethereum - when people can name several hyped projects, but can't see a bigger "towards the full-stack privacy" picture.

Ethereum Privacy Ecosystem will structure activities around privacy covering:

- **project diversity**: featuring not just well-known projects like Aztec, but newcomers like Nocturne
- **dev-friendly**: analyze privacy-centric hackathons from ETHRome to ETHBerlin (events, projects)
- **innovation**: emerging concepts from stealth-addresses to EIP-7503
- **tech breakdown**: specify underliying tech/approaches from ZK to PP 
- **funding**: provide approach to privacy funding in Ethereum (sources from Gitcoin to VCs; practical examples from 2023)
- **challenges**: map areas to be tackled by the next generation of devs on the way to Vitalik's cypherphunk vision (like Nocturne's privacy policy)

_Important purpose_: 
- create privacy-centric vocabulary that will help builders, researchers, startupers speak common language & empower existing privacy stack.
- visualise complex Privacy Ecosystem in infographics

## Homework
1. [Privacy services DB](https://github.com/web3privacy/explorer). We have the majority of the Ethereum-related projects in our database (need to actualize the data).
2. [Extensive Privacy project profile](https://github.com/web3privacy/explorer). Currently we are building platform that will feature detailed privacy project profile from on-chain data to funding. It will be used a source of data inputs to the research.

## Timing: 7 weeks
### Budget: 8,000 USD

### Milestones

### 1. Preliminary research
Purpose: assemble raw market data (authonomously & through one-on-one interviews with experts) + create separate Ethereum-centric DD.md based on our [Privacy projects DB](https://github.com/web3privacy/web3privacy)

- Timing: 2 weeks
- Budget: 3,000 USD

| Result  | Description |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Ethereum Privacy Ecosystem DB on Git | Separate MD for external collaborators to contribute with PRs covering projects, hackathon solions, labs, DAOs, coins, papers etc |

### 2. Deep research
Purpose: collect detailed data on every project from the links to the product-readiness.

Active research, collaboration with PSE team, one-on-one interviews from Railgun_ to Aztec, feedback loop from Ethereum protocol team to ETH pro-privacy hackathons teams.

- Timing: 3 weeks
- Budget: 3,000 USD

### Tasks

| Result  | Description |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Data aggregation | public data |
| Interviewing | 20 one-on-one interviews |
| Community engagement | Web3privacy community engagement: public call to contribution, the latest data sharing etc |

### 3. Design, copy & publishing
- Timing: 2 weeks
- Budget: 2,000 USD

| Result  | Description |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Tables, Infographics | Ecosystem map design (general map + caregories) |
| Copy | Final copy |
| Publishing | Mirror article + Git repo (DB + PDF-report) + X |
