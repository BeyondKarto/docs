e# Ethereum Privacy Ecosystem - report

Research will cover comprehensive & up to date report on the state of privacy in Ethereum.

**Details**

Ethereum ecosystem lacks detailed & actual report covering all the projects contributing to Ethereum privacy stack. This creates missunderstanding & shallow view on the state of privacy in Ethereum - when people can name several hyped projects, but can't see a bigger "towards the full-stack privacy" picture.

Ethereum Privacy Ecosystem will structure activities around privacy covering:

- well-known projects like Aztec & newcomers like Nocturne
- analyze privacy-centric hackathons from ETHRome to ETHBerlin
- emerging concepts from stealth-addresses to EIP-7503
- provide approach to privacy funding in Ethereum

Important purpose: create privacy-centric vocabulary that will help many builders, researchers, startupers speak common language & empower existing privacy stack.

## Timing: 50 days
