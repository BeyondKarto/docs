# Get involved

## _So you wish to be part of W3PN Ecosystem?? Letâ€™s make sure we are on the same page about what our work is all about._

Despite the foundational role that privacy is meant to play in shaping Web3, genuinely impactful initiatives remain scarce. Many projects leverage the concept of privacy as a buzzword or for public relations advantage, rather than addressing tangible issues or enacting substantial changes at the infrastructural and transactional level.

We aim to change this by building practical tools, reserach and guidelines.

### ðŸŽ¯ Our Ultimate Goal: Pioneering Privacy in the web3 era.
Empowering individuals to take control of their digital privacy through the Web3 stack.
We envision a world where privacy is a conscious, actively chosen lifestyle, accessible to everyone, everywhere.

### Why & How
In the digital age, privacy is not just a priority but a fundamental human right.

Our diverse array of research, projects and tools are fueled by people who care about digital privacy, and we aim to maintain this authenticity through your continued support and the vibrant help of all those people who care about Privacy - the community.

_algorhithm_:
1. Open database https://github.com/web3privacy/web3privacy
2. Pick up a category (from DeFi to Infrastructure)
3. Check

- product-readiness (actual state: devnet, testnet, mainnet)
- team status (public, anon)
- github/docs-readiness (available/not)
- ecosystem
- token (yes/no/Coinmarketcap link).
4. Add missing data & make a PR.

### categorisation
_goal_: broader list of categories within the privacy market.
_algorhithm_:
1. Open database https://github.com/web3privacy/web3privacy
2. Check ["other"](https://github.com/web3privacy/web3privacy#Other) & ["dapps"](https://github.com/web3privacy/web3privacy#dapps) categories.
3. Find sub-categories (min 3-4 projects per category). Examples: "marketplaces" or "data lakes".
4. Once a new sub-category has been found - create it & move those projects under it.

### sunset
_goal_: actual information on terminated or abandoned projects.
_algorhithm_:
1. Open database https://github.com/web3privacy/web3privacy
2. Check sunset projects (Twitter &/or Discord activity, GitHub activity).
3. 6 months hiatus - mark them with an icon of the moon next to them.

### category accuracy
_goal_: check Infrastructure, dApps, Other categories if projects really belong there (some projects misslead readers pretending to be infrastructure, for example)
_algorhithm_:
1. Open database https://github.com/web3privacy/web3privacy
2. Check projects' website, documentation.
3. Make observations if a projects belongs to particular category (infrastructure - providing broader protocol toolkit for different decentralised implementations).
4. If project nature differs from category where it exists - move it to the right category.
